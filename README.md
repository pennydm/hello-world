Test Repository for Learning

I am learning Amazon Web Services. I am not currently a developer, and that is not the direction of my learning to date. I am learning web security and site infrastructure.  This will enable me to design site structures to suit the needs of (future) clients.

In this vein, I am learning to use Git and - by extension - GitHub for version control.
